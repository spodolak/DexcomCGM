### Name of Project: Continuous Blood Sugar Monitoring Application 

### Project's Purpose or Goal: 

Empower Type 1 diabetes management through mindfulness(for kids!)

The application displays the user's current blood sugar values and teaches the user body awareness by prompting them to log physical symptoms during critical blood sugar changes.  The user should be wearing a Dexcom Continuous Glucose Monitor [CGM].

### User Stories: 
* As a child with type 1 diabetes, I want to develop body awareness so I can identify signs of adverse blood sugar changes and be empowered to manage my own blood sugar levels. 

  - I need a simple and motivating way of identifying and tracking my daily feelings.
  - I need to be reminded to check in with my body during glucose highs, lows, when I wake up in the morning, when I eat, 2 hours after I eat.
* As a parent, I want to actively participate in my childâ€™s diabetic experience so I can better validate and motivate their blood sugar management.
* As a physician, I want to collect realtime patient symptom data that correlates with blood sugar values. This will allow me to make psychosocially informed treatment plans that increase patient compliance.

### Absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Allow user to log into their Dexcom account from this application.
* After user logs into dexcom, they are re-routed back to application home page
User's blood sugar value is displayed on app. 

### Tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources:

* React front-end/UI
* Dexcom API
* C# back-end(stretch goal)

### Stretch Goals

* Allow user to log physical symptoms at any time.
* Prompt user to log physical symptoms during critical changes in blood sugar levels.
* Implement data modeling to display user's past blood sugar values and physical symptoms over time.
* Add realtime updating functionality (so patient blood sugar values are updated every 2 minutes)
