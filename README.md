# Continuous Glucose Monitoring with [Dexcom](https://www.dexcom.com/)

#### Empower Type 1 diabetes management through mindfulness (for kids!)

The application displays the user's current blood sugar values and teaches the user body awareness by prompting them to log physical symptoms during critical blood sugar changes.  The user should be wearing a [Dexcom Continuous Glucose Monitor [CGM]](https://www.dexcom.com/g6/how-it-works).

## User Stories

* As a child with type 1 diabetes, I want to develop body awareness so I can identify signs of adverse blood sugar changes and be empowered to manage my own blood sugar levels. 
  - I need a simple and motivating way of identifying and tracking my daily feelings.
  - I need to be reminded to check in with my body during glucose highs, lows, when I wake up in the morning, when I eat, 2 hours after I eat.
* As a parent, I want to actively participate in my childâ€™s diabetic experience so I can better validate and motivate their blood sugar management.
* As a physician, I want to collect realtime patient symptom data that correlates with blood sugar values. This will allow me to make psychosocially informed treatment plans that increase patient compliance.
